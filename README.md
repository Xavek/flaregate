**FlareGate**
Flaregate will be the first-of-its-kind fully decentralized cross-chain bridge from Flare to all EVM chains for any fungible asset. The MVP built at **ETHOxford** from scratch, demonstrates potential in a bidirectional bridge between Ethereum Sepolia and Flare Coston from Flare provided tokens (USDT-0 - USDT-9) to Ethereum provided tokens especially created for this hack. We will show end-to-end transfer of the token (bidirectionally) at 1:1 pricing.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
